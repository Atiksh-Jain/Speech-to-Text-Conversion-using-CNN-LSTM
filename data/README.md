# Data Organization

This directory contains all training data organized by source.

## Directory Structure

```

├── raw/
│   ├── user_recorded/      # Your 800 manual recordings (add tomorrow)
│   ├── tts_generated/       # TTS-generated samples (generated now)
│   └── commonvoice/         # Common Voice samples (optional)
└── manifests/
    ├── train.csv            # Training manifest
    └── val.csv             # Validation manifest
```

## Data Sources

### 1. User Recorded (800 samples - add tomorrow)
- Your manual recordings
- Place files in: `data/raw/user_recorded/`
- Update: `data/manifests/train.csv` with paths

### 2. TTS Generated (200-300 samples - generated now)
- Text-to-Speech generated samples
- Generated by: `python scripts/generate_tts_samples.py`
- Saved to: `data/raw/tts_generated/`

### 3. Common Voice (500 samples - optional)
- Common Voice dataset samples
- Integrated by: `python scripts/integrate_commonvoice.py`
- Saved to: `data/raw/commonvoice/`

## CSV Format

Both `train.csv` and `val.csv` use the same format:
```csv
path,text
raw/user_recorded/sample_001.wav,hello how are you
raw/tts_generated/tts_0001.wav,this is a test
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ TTS samples generated (done now)
2. ⏳ Add your 800 recordings (tomorrow)
3. ⏳ Optional: Add Common Voice samples
4. ⏳ Run: `python check_data_quality.py`
5. ⏳ Run: `python run_all.py` to train
