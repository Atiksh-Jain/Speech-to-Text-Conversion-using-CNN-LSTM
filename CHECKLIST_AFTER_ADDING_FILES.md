# Checklist: After Adding New Audio Files

## Step 1: Verify Files Are Added
- [ ] Audio files placed in `data/raw/` directory
- [ ] CSV manifests (`train.csv` and `val.csv`) updated with new file paths
- [ ] CSV format: `path,text` (e.g., `raw/utt001.wav,hello world`)

## Step 2: Check Data Quality
```bash
python check_data_quality.py
```
- [ ] No critical errors (corrupted files)
- [ ] Review warnings (sample rate, stereo - these are OK)
- [ ] Note total valid file count

## Step 3: List Any Problematic Files
```bash
python list_corrupted_files.py
```
- [ ] Fix or remove any corrupted files
- [ ] Update CSV manifests if files removed

## Step 4: Verify Dataset Size
- [ ] Check total samples in train.csv + val.csv
- [ ] Target: 800-1000 samples (or more)
- [ ] Current: Check with `python check_data_quality.py`

## Step 5: Start Training
```bash
python run_all.py
```
- [ ] Training runs without errors
- [ ] Checkpoints saved in `checkpoints/`
- [ ] Training history saved to `training_history.json`

## Step 6: Monitor Training (Optional)
```bash
python check_training.py
```
- [ ] Check if model is learning (WER decreasing)
- [ ] Verify loss is decreasing

## Step 7: Generate Plots
- [ ] Plots automatically generated by `run_all.py`
- [ ] Check `web/static/plots/` directory
- [ ] All required figures present

## Step 8: Test Web App
```bash
cd web
python app.py
```
- [ ] Web app starts without errors
- [ ] Microphone recording works
- [ ] Transcription appears (may have errors initially)

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check data quality
python check_data_quality.py

# List corrupted files
python list_corrupted_files.py

# Check training progress
python check_training.py

# Start training
python run_all.py

# Evaluate model
python -m src.evaluate --csv data/manifests/val.csv --checkpoint checkpoints/best_by_wer.pt

# Test inference
python -m src.infer --audio data/raw/utt001.wav --checkpoint checkpoints/best_by_wer.pt
```

## Important Notes

- **Sample Rate**: Any sample rate is OK (will be resampled to 16kHz automatically)
- **Stereo Audio**: OK (will be converted to mono automatically)
- **File Format**: WAV format preferred (other formats may work but WAV is safest)
- **Corrupted Files**: Must be fixed or removed before training

## Expected Timeline After Adding Files

- Data quality check: 2-5 minutes
- Training (30 epochs): 2-4 hours (CPU)
- Plot generation: 1-2 minutes
- Web app testing: 5-10 minutes

**Total: ~3-5 hours from file addition to working demo**

Good luck! 🚀
